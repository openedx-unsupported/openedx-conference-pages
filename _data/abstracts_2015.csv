The open edX platform enables MIT Lincoln Laboratory to share the knowledge of world-class domain experts through technical education courses highlighting theory and its use in practice.  Building successful online courses requires that technical professionals, with limited teaching experience, develop a teaching mindset.  In this presentation we discuss the approaches used to help non-faculty instructors gain an awareness of the open edX andragogy and the path followed to transition from presenter to educational guide."Building the Plane While Flying it - Migrating an Existing MOOC to edX,"Mike Bifulco, Andrew Miller, Jeremy Osborn, and Michael Bingham-Hawk","Over the past year, Aquent's MOOC for designers, <a href=""http://www.thegymnasium.com/"">The Gymnasium</a>, has been going through the process of migrating to Open EdX from a third-party SaaS platform. During this talk, we'll discuss what our move was like - including requirements gathering, theming and customization of the edx platform, migration of the many thousands of existing student records, creation of courses on EdX, and setting up a production deployment environment and life cycle with a hosting partner."Configuration Primer,Feanil Patel,"Open edX uses ansible for configuration management.  This talk would give people an overview of the configuration repo, introducing the layout and organization of our ansible roles with some examples of how to use them."Contributing to Open edX,Xavier Antoviaque and Sarina Canelake,"You want to contribute to edX? This talk will walk you through the Open edX contribution process, step by step, using a sample contribution as an example."Deploying SPOCs in a University Institution with Open edX: What Do We Need?,Francisco Cruz Argudo,"The presentation try to describe the experience of creating and exploiting of SPOCs at UC3M for use to supplement classroom training (flipping classroom) using the Open edX platform. In the presentation we will try  various aspects like customizing the platform to adapt to our environment (for example LDAP support) and additional software tools which we have had to be developed to facilitate the whole process management and content creation, which takes associated with the creation of a MOOCs / SPOCs. In addition we have developed several XBlocks to include new features to our courses. We finally will treat aspects that an organization has to take into account to successfully approach these projects."Digging through the data - MoocCzar,Andrew Dekker and John Zornig,"This talk discusses the research data package that edX provides to partners, and how this data can be explored to learn more about the students taking our courses.  To assist in this, we have developed a platform - MoocCzar, an open source project which helps edX teams uncover and disseminate data gathered from edX courses.  The talk discusses the development and future of MoocCzar, and how this learning data can help influence future course design and development."Leveraging Open Edx for Corporate Training,Cathy Herbert,"Today's corporate learner needs access to ondemand training delivered in easily consumable chunks - anytime, anywhere.  They also need a forum to ""talk to the instructor.""  Open Edx provides the perfect platform for a blended training model which gives users what they need and better utilizes your training resources. (often product managers, or functional leaders). Targeted Sales Training for internal employees and partners - while traditional testing methods are effective, Edx gives us the ability to run ""Best in Class"" sales competitions (based on videos submitted by the employee/partner).  This is huge - the system gives us the ability to have Sales professionals practice their pitch and get  direct feedback from their manager and team members.  "Life in the Avant-Garde,Regis Behmo,"As developers of a platform based on Open edX, we tend to follow pretty closely the master branch of the edx-platform repository. On the other hand, our infrastructure differs greatly from edX, in particular for storage. How do we manage to keep up with upstream development while maintaining our sanity? In this talk, we will describe our internal deployment processes, the tricks we found to overcome some issues, and will give advice to the edX developers to keep fostering a great open source community."MIT Learning Object Repository for Education,Peter Wilkins,"We will discuss our new project for managing courseware content across courses, disciplines and runs via our LORE project (<a href=""https://github.com/mitodl/lore"">https://github.com/mitodl/lore</a>).  LORE allows you to import Open edX courses and be paired with meta data from analytics such as the average grade, or number of attempts.  From there you can use it to find, categorize, and mix and match problems or whole sections of different courses to share and re-use existing content in new ways."Navigating Barriers to Implementation of an International Medical Training Course in Developing Nations,Nicholus Warstadt,"Clubfoot is a congenital birth deformity easily and effectively treatable by the low-resource requiring and non-surgical Ponseti method, but knowledge of this technique has yet to disseminate to rural hospitals and clinics in developing countries. Current training practices are dominated by non-profit organizations investing extensive time, resources, and man-power to host centralized, annual trainings. Here, we describe our experience in working with these same non-profit organizations to develop and implement a standardized digital training through the Open edX platform, including barriers of technology, multi-instance administration, and the need for content customization. "Online Geospatial Education in Africa through the Open edX Platform: Possibilities and Limitations,Thomas Ballatore,"Here, we discuss the particular challenges of translating a set of successful onsite geospatial training courses into a set of Open edX online courses for learners in Africa. We present work done in 14 countries (Algeria, Burundi, Chad, Cote d'Ivoire, DR Congo, Egypt, Ethiopia, Kenya, Malawi, Morocco, Rwanda, Tanzania, Uganda, and Zimbabwe) about user experience with current edX courses as well as experience and lessons for planned Open edX courses on geospatial topics."Open edX and Adaptive Learning,Glyn Polson,This discussion would focus on the need for different assessment functionalities with a focus on adaptive learning. This talk will provide examples of how adaptive learning works within the Open edX platform."OpenStack for edX: Inside, and Out",Adolfo Brandes and Florian Haas,"You're planning a highly-available LMS deployment for thousands of students. Your courses teach various facets of distributed computing, so you want each and every one of your students to have a fully scaled-out, distributed environment to play with (and break!).  As icing on the cake, you want to deploy on OpenStack, the hottest cloud tech on the market.  How do you build all this so that courses don't cost a fortune? We took a stab at it, and here we'll share how we: 1) run edX itself on OpenStack, and 2) leverage the flexibility of both edX and OpenStack to fire up (and bring down!) lab environments on demand, and present them seamlessly to the student."Pragmatic development lessons from UQx,Andrew Dekker and John Zornig,"This talk reflects on the development that the UQx team has conducted over the last 18 months, and discusses the various tools we have developed to help UQx students to achieve their learning objectives.  The talk will also discuss the practical limitations of working with online platforms (in particular edX), and how we leverage the platform to create the best experience possible.  We will detail how we decide which technologies and processes to use when developing a solution, and present recommendations on how to develop new tools within the platform."Real Time Analytics Using ELK,Felipe Montoya,"This talk presents an application of the opensource ELK stack (Elasticsearch, Logstash and Kibana) to deliver actionable insights in real time from edX tracking log records."Semantic Tagging Using Asides in Studio,Cole Shaw and Ross Strader,"In this talk, we will discuss one of the first implementations of XBlock Asides, which we use to semantically tag problems in edX courses. Both MIT and the Open Learning Initiative at Stanford will present on their respective use cases and show how Asides can enhance the student and instructor experiences."
